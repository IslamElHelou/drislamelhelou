## Why biopsies matter

Many skin conditions can look similar. When the diagnosis is uncertain, repeating treatments may delay the correct answer.

A **skin biopsy** is a small procedure that helps us confirm what is happening under the surface.

## Common reasons we recommend a biopsy

- A rash that **does not improve** as expected
- A lesion that **keeps changing**
- When the clinical picture suggests more than one possibility
- To rule out conditions that require specific treatment

## What to expect

- Done under local anesthesia
- Usually takes a few minutes
- Mild discomfort afterward
- Results guide a more accurate plan

## Key message

**A biopsy is a tool for clarity.** The goal is a confident diagnosis and a treatment plan that truly fits the condition.
