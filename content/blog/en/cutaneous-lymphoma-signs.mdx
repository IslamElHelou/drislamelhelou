## Most chronic rashes are not lymphoma

The majority of long‑standing rashes are inflammatory conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, or drug reactions.

However, a small group of patients can present with patterns that deserve **re‑evaluation**.

## Red flags that justify reassessment

- A rash that **persists for months** despite appropriate treatment
- **Unusual distribution** or changing morphology
- **New plaques or patches** that keep appearing
- **Persistent itch** with minimal response
- Suspicious findings on dermoscopy or examination

## What we do in practice

A structured approach may include:

- Full skin examination
- Reviewing previous treatments and response
- Considering biopsy when clinically indicated

## Key message

**When the pattern doesn’t fit, we don’t keep repeating the same therapy.** We reassess, confirm, and then treat with clarity.
