Pigmentation is common in coastal climates, and **melasma** in particular can feel frustrating because it often improves — then returns. The most effective approach is rarely a single product or a short “course”. It is a *strategy*.

## Why pigmentation returns

In many patients, pigmentation is driven by more than one factor:

- **UV and visible light exposure** (not only sunlight — also strong indoor light in some settings)
- **Inflammation** (acne marks, irritation, aggressive peels, friction)
- **Hormonal influence** (melasma patterns)
- **Skin barrier stress** (over‑exfoliation, frequent product switching)

When these triggers persist, pigmentation tends to recur even after good initial improvement.

## A structured management plan

### 1) Protect first (this is non‑negotiable)

- Daily broad‑spectrum sunscreen.
- Consider additional protection (shade, hats) when exposure is high.

### 2) Reduce inflammation

If your skin is irritated, many brightening routines fail. The goal is calm, consistent care.

### 3) Use targeted treatments thoughtfully

Short‑term improvement is common. Long‑term stability requires the right sequence and follow‑up, especially for melasma.

### 4) Avoid the “product rotation” trap

Frequent changes often increase irritation and slow progress. In practice, a simpler plan tends to be more sustainable.

## When evaluation is recommended

Consider a consultation if:

- Pigmentation persists beyond **8–12 weeks** despite consistent protection.
- Marks are worsening or spreading.
- You have recurrent melasma with repeated relapses.
