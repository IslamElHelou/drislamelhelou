## Psoriasis is not “just a skin rash”

Psoriasis is an **immune‑mediated inflammatory disease**. The visible plaques are the surface expression of a deeper inflammatory process.

## What this means for your care

When we treat psoriasis properly, the goal is not only to “calm the skin,” but to **control inflammation over time** and prevent repeated flares.

## Realistic goals

- Fewer flares and shorter flare duration
- Better itch control and sleep
- Improved quality of life
- Long‑term stability with a plan that fits your lifestyle

## Why some patients keep relapsing

Relapse usually happens when treatment focuses only on the current flare, without:

- identifying triggers (stress, infection, weight, smoking, medications)
- selecting a stepwise maintenance plan
- monitoring response and adjusting early

## When we consider advanced therapy

If psoriasis is frequent, extensive, or affecting nails/scalp significantly, we may consider stronger options. This decision is always individualized and based on benefit vs risk.

## Key message

**Psoriasis management is a long‑term strategy, not a short prescription.**
