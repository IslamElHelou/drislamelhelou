Acne is common—and very treatable. The key is **consistent treatment for enough time**.

## What actually improves acne

- **A retinoid** (adapalene / tretinoin) — prevents new clogged pores.
- **Benzoyl peroxide** — reduces bacteria and inflammation.
- **Azelaic acid** — helpful for sensitive skin and post‑acne marks.
- **For moderate–severe acne:** prescription options (oral antibiotics for limited time, hormonal therapy, or isotretinoin) based on your case.

## The most common mistakes

1. **Stopping too early.** Many treatments need *8–12 weeks* to show clear improvement.
2. **Over‑washing or harsh scrubs.** This irritates skin and can worsen breakouts.
3. **Using too many active products at once.** It’s better to build a simple routine.

## A simple starter routine

Morning:
- Gentle cleanser
- Benzoyl peroxide (thin layer, or wash)
- Moisturizer + sunscreen

Night:
- Gentle cleanser
- Retinoid (pea‑size amount)
- Moisturizer

> If you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have very sensitive skin, your plan should be adjusted.

## When to book a visit

- Painful cystic acne
- Scarring or dark marks that persist
- Acne that affects your confidence
- No improvement after 12 weeks of a consistent routine
