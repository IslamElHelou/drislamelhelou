## First: define the pattern

The most useful first step is identifying **the pattern**:

- **Diffuse shedding** (often telogen effluvium)
- **Pattern thinning** (androgenetic alopecia)
- **Patchy loss** (alopecia areata, tinea, traction)
- **Scarring signs** (needs early attention)

## The 3 questions that change the diagnosis

1. **When did it start?** Sudden vs gradual
2. **Is shedding or thinning?** Hair on pillow/shower vs reduced density
3. **Any scalp symptoms?** Itch, scale, burning, pain

## When tests may be needed

Tests are not for everyone. We consider them when history and exam suggest a systemic driver:

- iron deficiency
- thyroid imbalance
- vitamin D deficiency (in selected cases)
- hormonal factors (when clinically indicated)

## When to worry

Seek evaluation early if you have:

- widening patches
- scalp pain/burning
- shiny/scarred areas
- associated eyebrow/eyelash loss

## Key message

**Hair loss is a diagnosis, not a single disease.** A structured assessment saves time and prevents unnecessary treatments.
