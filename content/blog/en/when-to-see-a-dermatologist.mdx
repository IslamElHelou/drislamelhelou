Many skin concerns improve with simple, consistent care. Others benefit from earlier evaluation — not because they are dangerous, but because a clear diagnosis saves time and unnecessary treatments.

## Consider booking an assessment when…

- A rash persists beyond **2–3 weeks** despite basic care.
- Acne becomes **painful**, widespread, or starts leaving marks.
- Hair shedding persists beyond **8–12 weeks**, or there is patchy loss.
- Pigmentation keeps recurring despite consistent sun protection.

## Seek earlier review if you notice…

- A **new or changing mole** (shape, color, size, bleeding).
- A wound that does not heal.
- Rapidly spreading redness with pain or fever.
- Severe itch with sleep disturbance.

## What to bring to your consultation

- A short timeline: when it started and how it changed.
- Photos if the condition fluctuates.
- A list of products/medications used recently.

> This article is educational. If you are concerned about a rapidly changing lesion, earlier review is recommended.
